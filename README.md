# czech-imports-exports
Visualizations of Czech imports and exports figures using data from OEC.

My objective was to create an easily understandable Excel spreadsheet on Czech Republic's imports and exports. 

While the interactive visualizations available on https://oec.world/en/profile/country/cze were interesting,
they did not match with the needs of my research. 

Consequently, I downloaded the data and excluded the unnecessary information. Using python, I proceeded to
create specific subsets of the data and visualizing them inline with my research objective.

For both, imports and exports, I explored top industry sectors and origins/destinations. This information
is presented in table form and various plots (histograms and interactable choropleth maps).

The work was performed in Jupyter Notebooks and final results were imported to .xlsx spreadsheets.
